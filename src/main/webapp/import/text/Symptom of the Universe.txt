<b>Symptom of the Universe</b><br>
Take me through the centuries to supersonic years<br>
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears<br>
All I have to give you is a love that never dies<br>
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes<br>
<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
Mother Goose is calling me back to her silver womb<br>
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb<br>
Seventh night the unicorn is waiting in the skies<br>
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies<br>
<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears<br>
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years<br>
When our love will ride away into eternal skies<br>
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies<br>
<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
Oh my child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams<br>
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means<br>
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above<br>
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love<br>
