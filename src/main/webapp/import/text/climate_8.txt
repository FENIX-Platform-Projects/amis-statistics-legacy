Angola is located in western southern Africa at 6-18° south of the equator and although the country has a tropical climate, temperatures remain relatively cool (20-25°C) throughout the year due the high altitudes of the East African Plateau. Seasonal variations in temperature are small, dropping just below 20°C in the winter (JJA) and barely exceeding 25°C in the summer (DJF). The hot summer months are very dry, receiving almost no rainfall between June and August. 
The wet season rainfalls are controlled by the movement of the tropical rain belt (also known as the Inter-Tropical Conversion Zone, ITCZ) which oscillates between the northern and southern tropics over the course of a year, bringing rain in Angola between October and April of 100-250mm per month. The wettest region is the north-east, and total rainfall decreases southwards and towards the western coast.
