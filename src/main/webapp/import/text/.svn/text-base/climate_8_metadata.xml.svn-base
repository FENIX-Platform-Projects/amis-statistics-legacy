<abstractAbstract>General climate information extracted from the UNDP climate profiles. These profiles were funded jointly between the National Communications Support Program (NCSP) and the UK Department for International Development (DfID) and were developed to address the climate change information gap in many developing countries by making use of existing climate data to generate country-level data plots from the most up-to-date climate observations and the multi-model projections from the WCRP CMIP3 archive (Meehl et al., 2007).</abstractAbstract>
