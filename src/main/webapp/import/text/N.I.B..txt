<br>
Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
Some people say my love cannot be true<br>
Please believe me, my love, and I'll show you<br>
I will give you those things you thought unreal<br>
The sun, the moon, the stars all bear my seal<br>
<br>
Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
Follow me now and you will not regret<br>
Leaving the life you led before we met<br>
You are the first to have this love of mine<br>
Forever with me 'till the end of time<br>
Your love for me has just got to be real<br>
Before you know the way I'm going to feel<br>
<br>
I'm going to feel<br>
I'm going to feel<br>
<br>
Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
Now I have you with me, under my power<br>
Our love grows stronger now with every hour<br>
Look into my eyes, you will see who I am<br>
My name is Lucifer, please take my hand<br>
<br>
Oh yeah!<br>
<br>
Follow me now and you will not regret<br>
leaving the life you led before we met<br>
You are the first to have this love of mine<br>

Your love for me has just got to be real<br>
Before you know the way I'm going to feel<br>
<br>
I'm going to feel<br>
