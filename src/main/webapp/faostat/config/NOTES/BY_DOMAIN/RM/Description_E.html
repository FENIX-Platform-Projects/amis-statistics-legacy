In 1996 and 2001, however, operators reported all farm vehicles, machinery and equipment that they owned or leased from others. The change affects the comparability of the 1996 and 2001 data with data from previous censuses. Starting in 1986, Agricultural tractors data include Garden tractors; from 2001, they also include all-terrain vehicles. Source: StatisticsCanada, Census of Agriculture</li>
