The FAOSTAT GHG-LULUCF database provide information for producing&nbsp;
inventories for the land use, land-use change and forestry sectors.<br />
<br />
Changes in land-based carbon stocks and ecosystem function linked to&nbsp;
anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, land-use change,&nbsp;
management change, etc., determine emissions and removals of greenhouse&nbsp;
gases that are reported by countries in the Intergovernmental Panel on&nbsp;
Climate Change (IPCC) Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)&nbsp;
categories.<br />
<br />
Greenhouse gas fluxes in the LULUCF comprise both those associated with&nbsp;
net changes in biomass and thus carbon (C) stocks over time and those&nbsp;
computed as changes in gas flux rates to and from the atmosphere. In&nbsp;
general, increases in total C stocks over time are equated with a net&nbsp;
removal of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from the atmosphere while&nbsp;
decreases in total C stocks (less transfers to other pools such as&nbsp;
harvested wood products) are equated with net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.&nbsp;
Significant CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are likewise associated to&nbsp;
combustion of residues associated to given land use or land-use change&nbsp;
practices. Non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are driven by changes in&nbsp;
microbiological processes within soils and discarded and decaying&nbsp;
organic material. <br />
<br />
The FAOSTAT GHG-LULUCF database reports activity data, emission factors&nbsp;
and emissions relative to the six IPCC categories: Forest Land,&nbsp;
Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements, and Other Land, following&nbsp;
IPCC guidelines. It is worth noting that IPCC and FAOSTAT differ in how&nbsp;
the six land-use categories are defined (see table below). Importantly,&nbsp;
wetlands ad settlements are not defined in the standard FAOSTAT land-use&nbsp;
questionnaire, although recent efforts are under way to include&nbsp;
reporting from these two land categories. <br />

		<td style='padding: 10px;'>Forest Land includes all land with&nbsp;
		woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land&nbsp;
		in the national greenhouse gas inventory. It also includes systems&nbsp;
		with a vegetation structure that currently fall below, but in situ&nbsp;
		could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to&nbsp;

		<td style='padding: 10px;'>Forest area is the land spanning more&nbsp;

		of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in&nbsp;
		situ (FRA). It does not include land that is predominantly under&nbsp;
		agricultural or urban land use. Forest is determined both by the&nbsp;
		presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The&nbsp;
		trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 metres (m) in&nbsp;
		situ. Areas under reforestation that have not yet reached but are&nbsp;
		expected to reach a canopy cover of 10 percent and a tree height of 5&nbsp;

		<b>Cropland</b></td>
		<td style='padding: 10px;'>Cropland includes arable and tillable&nbsp;
		land, rice fields, and agroforestry systems where the vegetation&nbsp;
		structure falls below the thresholds used for the Forest Land&nbsp;
		category, and is not expected to exceed those thresholds at a later&nbsp;
		time. Cropland includes all annual and perennial crops as well as&nbsp;
		temporary fallow land (i.e., land set at rest for one or several years&nbsp;
		before being cultivated again). Annual crops include cereals, oils&nbsp;
		seeds, vegetables, root crops and forages. Perennial crops include&nbsp;
		trees and shrubs, in combination with herbaceous crops (e.g.,&nbsp;
		agroforestry) or as orchards, vineyards and plantations such as cocoa,&nbsp;
		coffee, tea, oil palm, coconut, rubber trees, and bananas, except&nbsp;
		where these lands meet the criteria for categorisation as Forest Land.&nbsp;
		Arable land which is normally used for cultivation of annual crops but&nbsp;
		which is temporarily used for forage crops or grazing as part of an&nbsp;
		annual crop-pasture rotation (mixed system) is included under&nbsp;
		cropland.</td>
		<td style='padding: 10px;'>Arable land is the land under&nbsp;
		temporary agricultural crops (multiple-cropped areas are counted only&nbsp;
		once), temporary meadows for mowing or pasture, land under market and&nbsp;
		kitchen gardens and land temporarily fallow (less than five years).&nbsp;
		The abandoned land resulting from shifting cultivation is not included&nbsp;
		in this category. Data for “Arable land” are not meant to indicate the&nbsp;
		amount of land that is potentially cultivable. <br />
		<br />
		Permanent crops is the land cultivated with long-term crops which do&nbsp;
		not have to be replanted for several years; land under trees and&nbsp;
		shrubs producing flowers, such as roses and jasmine; and nurseries&nbsp;
		(except those for forest trees, which should be classified under&nbsp;
		"forest"). It includes agro-forestry systems, orchards, vineyards and&nbsp;
		plantations such as cocoa, coffee, rubber, oil palm etc. Permanent&nbsp;
		meadows and pastures are excluded from land under permanent crops.</td>

		<b>Grassland</b></td>
		<td style='padding: 10px;'>Grassland is defined as rangelands and&nbsp;
		pasture land that are not considered Cropland. Grasslands are&nbsp;
		generally dominated by perennial grasses but may include systems with&nbsp;
		woody vegetation and other non-grass vegetation such as herbs and&nbsp;
		brushes that fall below the thresholds used to define forests. They&nbsp;
		may include agricultural and silvi-pastoral systems consistent with&nbsp;
		national definitions. Grasslands vary greatly in their degree and&nbsp;
		intensity of management, from extensively managed rangelands and&nbsp;
		savannahs – where animal stocking rates and fire regimes are the main&nbsp;
		management variables – to intensively managed (e.g., with&nbsp;
		fertilization, irrigation, species changes) continuous pasture and hay&nbsp;
		land. Grasslands generally have vegetation dominated by perennial&nbsp;
		grasses, and grazing is the predominant land use.</td>
		<td style='padding: 10px;'>Permanent meadows and pastures is the&nbsp;
		land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage&nbsp;
		crops. It includes: cultivated pasture and naturally grown, that is&nbsp;

		Managed wetlands will be restricted to wetlands where the water table&nbsp;

When reporting emissions from land, countries distinguish—as per IPCC&nbsp;
guidelines—between land areas remaining in the same category –and land&nbsp;
areas converted from one category to another. In the former, reported&nbsp;
emissions or removals are those relative to land use (LU) activities,&nbsp;
such as forestry or pasture management practices, etc.; in the latter,&nbsp;
reported emissions or removals are those associated to land-use change&nbsp;
(LUC) practices, such as deforestation, conservation, etc. <br />
<br />
The LULUCF section has unique characteristics with respect to developing&nbsp;
inventory methods. There are many processes leading to emissions and&nbsp;
removals of greenhouse gases, which can be widely dispersed in space and&nbsp;
highly variable in time. Furthermore, the factors governing emissions&nbsp;
and removals can be both natural and anthropogenic (direct and indirect)&nbsp;
in nature, so that it can be difficult to clearly distinguish among&nbsp;
causal factors. While recognizing this complexity, the IPCC guidelines&nbsp;
followed herein attempt to prescribe rules for developing inventories in&nbsp;
practical, relatively easy steps that countries can follow, resulting in&nbsp;
databases that are relevant as well as operational, i.e., easily&nbsp;
revisable and updated at regular time intervals. <br />
