<div class='text'>Some of the most interesting data for economists is found in this domain. The national distribution of
land, among arable land, pastures and other lands, as well as the importance of irrigation are just some of the interesting data
sets. <br />

The Agricultural Resources domain covers:<br />

The Resources domain considers factors of production for the agricultural sector. Broadly speaking, this section details how
countries differ in endowments of the three classic inputs: labour, land and capital. Qualitative differences are important for
each but are particularly difficult to summarise in a single indicator for land, the productivity of which depends heavily on
water and soil conditions. <br />
