<!-- BODY TEXT SECTION -->

<div class='text'>The Prices domain of FAOSTAT contains:
<ul class='bullet-list'>
	<li>Producer Prices or prices received by farmers for primary crops, live animals weight and livestock primary products as
	collected at the point of initial sale (prices paid at the farm-gate). Data are provided for over 130 countries and for some
	200 commodities, representing over 97 percent of the worldâ€™s value of gross agricultural production (at 2004-2006 International
	Dollar Prices). <br />
	<br />
	Producer Prices provides price data in three units: i) Local Currency Units (LCU); ii) Standard Local Currency (SLC); and, iii)
	US Dollars. Although, both LCU and SLC denote prices in the local currency of a country, there is an important distinction
	between the two units. Prices in LCU refer to the currency prevailing in a country in the year of data reporting. Thus, if
	there is (are) currency change(s) in a country during the years for which data is available, the data series will refer to more
	than one currency. Please see the Currency Table in the Producer Prices webpage for information on currencies. Prices in SLC
	are standardised to reflect data in one currency only, normally the currency in the most recent year of data reporting. Having
	price data series in the same currency helps in 'smoothing' data series and is particularly useful for analysing time series
	data or constructing price indices. <br />
	<br />
	Producer Prices contains data from 1991 onwards, whilst the Price Archive contains historical data from 1966 to 1990. However,
	these two data sets may not always be comparable. Please see the Price Archive page for more information. <br />
	<br />
	Whilst countries are requested by FAO to provide prices received by farmers, it is possible that some countries do not collect
	such prices and may report an alternative set of data, mainly, wholesale prices or unit values compiled for national accounts.
	Please visit the Country Notes in the Producer Prices webpage for country-specific information.</li>

	<li>Indices of agricultural producer prices that measure the average annual change over time in the selling prices
	received by farmers (prices at the farm-gate or at the first point of sale). Annual data are provided for over 80 countries.
	The two categories of producer price indices available in FAOSTAT comprise: Agriculture Producer Price Index; and Single item
	indices.</li>

	<li>Monthly (or quarterly) Food and non-alcoholic beverages consumer price indices that measure changes over time in the
	prices of food that households acquire, use or pay for consumption. These are sub-indices of All items consumer price indices,
	also disseminated on FAOSTAT, that cover all goods and services included for price measurement in the CPI.</li>
