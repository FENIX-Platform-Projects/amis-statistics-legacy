The Greenhouse Gases from Agriculture domain (GHG Agriculture) contains&nbsp;
IPCC Tier 1 estimates of anthropogenic GHG emissions from Enteric&nbsp;
Fermentation, Manure Management, Rice Cultivation, and Agricultural&nbsp;
Soils, covering more than 85 percent of overall GHG emissions for the&nbsp;
agriculture sector Total GHG emissions from agriculture are 10-12&nbsp;
percent of total anthropogenic emissions, and are estimated at about&nbsp;
5.1-6.1 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>eq (IPCC 2007). <br />
<br />
<i>Agricultural soils</i> are a main source of nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)&nbsp;
through direct and indirect emissions from managed soils, and of carbon&nbsp;
dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) from liming and urea fertilization. They&nbsp;
represent about 38 percent of total agricultural emissions. Direct&nbsp;
emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O from the soil are largely determined by&nbsp;
applied synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, organic fertilization, manure&nbsp;
deposition on pastures, amount of N in crop residues, mineralization of&nbsp;
N, and drainage, as well as by other management practices in organic&nbsp;
soils (e.g., peatlands). N<sub>2</sub>O can also be released in the&nbsp;
atmosphere following two indirect pathways; the first consists of&nbsp;
emissions from N compounds that have previously volatized from managed&nbsp;
soils, from fossil fuel combustion and from biomass burning; while the&nbsp;
second is caused by emissions from N compounds in leaching and runoff of&nbsp;
Nitrogen previously applied to managed soils. <br />
<br />
<i>Enteric fermentation</i> is a microbial process that takes place in&nbsp;
the digestive systems of ruminants (cattle, buffalo, goats, sheep, and&nbsp;
camelids), and to a lesser extent in those of non-ruminant animals (e.g.&nbsp;
pigs, horses). It represents about 32 percent of all agricultural&nbsp;
emissions. Microbial fermentation occurs in the rumen enabling ruminant&nbsp;
animals to digest coarse plant material which cannot be otherwise&nbsp;
digested by non-ruminant, mono-gastric animals. Microbial fermentation&nbsp;
is an anaerobic process, i.e., occurring without oxygen, which produces&nbsp;
large quantities of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Since the global warming&nbsp;
potential (GWP) of methane is higher than that of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;
(GWP=21, i.e., on tonne of methane emissions have 21 times the warming&nbsp;
effect of a tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>), and because of the large numbers&nbsp;
of livestock animals globally, enteric fermentation is an important item&nbsp;
in GHG emissions from Agriculture. <br />
<br />
<i>Livestock manure</i> is also a source of CH<sub>4</sub> (from&nbsp;
anaerobic decomposition of manure) as well as of N<sub>2</sub>O (from&nbsp;
aerobic and anaerobic decomposition processes, which determine&nbsp;
nitrification and denitrification of the nitrogen). Emissions from&nbsp;
manure are about 7 percent of the total. A variety of factors such as&nbsp;
temperature, aeration and oxygen level, animal diet, manure type&nbsp;
(liquid/solid ratio), and moisture influence GHG gas emissions from&nbsp;
manure. All these factors are determined by the manure management&nbsp;
practices adopted. <br />
<br />
Flooded rice fields are a source of methane through the anaerobic&nbsp;
decomposition of organic matter in paddy soils. Emissions from rice&nbsp;
fields are about 11 percent of the total. Factors influencing emissions&nbsp;
from rice fields are water management regimes, crop density, length of&nbsp;
growth period, adopted cultivar, application of fertilizers and&nbsp;
amendants (organic and inorganic) as well as local temperature regimes&nbsp;
and soils. <br />
