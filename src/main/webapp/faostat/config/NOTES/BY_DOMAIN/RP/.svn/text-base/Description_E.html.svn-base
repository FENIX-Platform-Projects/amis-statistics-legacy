The Statistics Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations started the collection of data on consumption of major 
individual pesticides products about three decades ago. However, 
the response to the related Pesticides Consumption Annual Questionnaire 
sent to all member countries was not very encouraging. Therefore, in 1986 
in co-operation with the Commission of the European Union, a study was
 undertaken to find ways to improve the country coverage of the data. 
 The present work of collecting data on groups of pesticides is a result of 
 the recommendations of this study. Data collected earlier have been published 
 in various issues of the Production Yearbook. The present database refers to the 
 quantity of pesticides used in or sold to the agricultural sector for 
 crops and seeds; data are expressed in metric tons of active ingredients. 
Information on quantities applied to single crops is not available.
