Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities in 
a standardized form. The scope of standardization is to present these data 
in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing 
any significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. 
The selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling 
in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived 
commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of 
different commodity groups. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Commodity coverage</b>
<br/><br/>
The commodity list in this domain has been generally confined to primary commodities 
- except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages. Whenever possible trade in 
processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary commodity equivalent. 
Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.
