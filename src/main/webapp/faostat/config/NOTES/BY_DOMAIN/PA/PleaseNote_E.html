<b>Price Archive:</b> In the year 1995 the price series in the FAOSTAT were interrupted for some time
due to resource constraints. Due to lack of resources detailed work could not be done for countries which have not provided any
basic data and also for the period ending in 1990. Historical data on producer prices being compiled and disseminated earlier
are still available under Price Archive. However, for various known reasons the two data-sets may differ in the overlapping year
of 1991. FAO Statistics Division would not like to give any explanation for differences in the two sets. Users using a
combination of two sets may keep this limitation in mind.
<br /><br />
<b>Units:</b> Data is provided in three units: i) Local Currency Units (<b>LCU</b>); ii) Standard Local Currency (<b>SLC</b>); and, iii) US
Dollars. Although, both LCU and SLC denote prices in the local currency of a country, there is an important distinction between
the two units. Prices in LCU refer to the currency prevailing in a country in the year of data reporting. Thus, if there is
(are) currency change(s) in a country during the years for which data is available, the data series will refer to more than one
currency. Please see the <b>Local Currency</b> section under <b>Methods & Standards</b> for information on currencies. Prices in SLC are
standardised to reflect data in one currency only, normally the currency in the most recent year of data reporting. Having price
data series in the same currency helps in 'smoothing' data series and is particularly useful for analysing time series data or
constructing price indices.
<br /><br />
<b>Country Notes:</b> Whilst countries are requested by FAO to provide prices received by farmers, it is possible that some
countries do not collect such prices and may report an alternative set of data, mainly, wholesale prices or unit values compiled
for national accounts.
