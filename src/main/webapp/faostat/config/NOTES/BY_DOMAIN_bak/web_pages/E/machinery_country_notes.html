<p><u><strong>Trade Data</strong></u></p>
<p><em><strong>Norway: </strong></em>Track-laying tractors data: almost all these tractors are used outside agriculture. Other agricultural tractors data: about 80% of the tractors are used in agriculture. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2008</em> </p>
<p><em><strong>Occupied Palestinian Territory: </strong></em>the PCBS advises to use the numbers cautiously as they are based on various statistical data sources and the different mechanisms adopted by each data source. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2007</em></p>

<p><u><strong>Number in use data</strong></u></p>
<p><em><strong>Bangladesh: </strong></em>Ploughs data refer to the number of farm families assuming that each farm family has one plough. <em>Source: Agriculture Information Service, Ministry of Agriculture (reference 2007 FAO Resources questionnaire)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Canada: </strong></em>in Agricultural censuses prior to 1996, the agricultural operations reported the farm vehicles, machinery and equipment located on their operations on Census Day, regardless of ownership. In 1996 and 2001, however, operators reported all farm vehicles, machinery and equipment that they owned or leased from others. The change affects the comparability of the 1996 and 2001 data with data from previous censuses. Starting in 1986, Agricultural tractors data include Garden tractors; from 2001, they also include all-terrain vehicles. <em>Source: StatisticsCanada, Census of Agriculture </em></p>
<p><em><strong>China:</strong></em> Pedestrian controlled tractors data refer to small tractors. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2008</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Czech Rep:</strong></em> starting in 2007 Milking machines data refer to stall-fixed milking equipment, thus excluding &quot;independent milking parlours and mobile milking equipment&rdquo;. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2008. </em></p>

<p><em><strong>Estonia:</strong></em> prior to the year 2001 the Milking machines data include Installations. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2007</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hungary:</strong></em> from 1961 to 1990, data on Agricultural tractors and Combine harvester-threshers refer to numbers in use in the cooperative farms only. Starting in 1991, data also cover tractors and harvester-threshers used in corporations and private farms. <em>Source: Food and agricultural statistics 1997, Budapest, 1998. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Iran:</strong></em> 2007 figure on Pedestrian controlled tractors refers to tillers only. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2008</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Mali:</strong></em> Ploughs data refer to ploughs and pedestrian tractors. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2008</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Norway:</strong></em> Milking machines: close to all holdings with dairy cows and dairy goats have milking machines. The reported figures are the total of holdings with dairy cows and holdings with dairy goats. <em>Source: Annual Questionnaire 2008</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Occupied PalestinianTerritory:</strong></em> Ploughs data refer to Grain drills. <em>Source: Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) </em></p>

<p><em><strong>Saint Lucia:</strong></em> the result of the 1996 and 2007 Agricultural censuses are roughly comparable because the 1996 one refers to machinery &quot;used&quot; while the 2007 one refers to machinery &quot;owned and used&quot;. <em>Source: Census of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Fisheries and Forestry. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Swaziland:</strong></em> Agricultural tractors data include all tractors irrespective of their size and ownership; in addition the Country stressed that figures may not be accurate due to difficulty in obtaining data. <em>Source: Annual questionnaire 2008</em></p>

<p><em><strong>USA:</strong></em> Agricultural tractors data from 1961 to 1987 are composed of Wheel and Track-laying tractors (exclusive of steam and garden) (Source: Economic Research Service). Starting in 1988, the data are composed of Tractors less than 40 horsepower (excluding garden tractors), 40 to 99 horsepower and 100 horsepower or more. Combine harvesters-threshers covered in the 1997 Agricultural census refer to all types of combines. Data collected in the 2002 and 2007 Agricultural censuses refer to self-propelled combines only. <em>Source: Agricultural census 2007 </em></p>
