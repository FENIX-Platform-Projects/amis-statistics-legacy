The FPMU Workstation is a web-based food security oriented information
system to visualize, publish, harmonize, process and disseminate spatial
and non-spatial information directly through the internet. The
information in the FPMU workstation are regularly collected and uploaded
by a network of partner agencies (including the Department of
Agriculture Marketing, MISM of the DG Food, Helen Keller International)
and the FPMU. Users can easily view, download and perform analysis of
information directly from the FPMU application, through the chart,
table, map and statistical modules.
