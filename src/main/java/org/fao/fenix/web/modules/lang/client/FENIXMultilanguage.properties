To create a multidimensional table the user defines an aggregation function and a set of dimensions that become the columns and the rows of the final table. For each column-row intersection FENIX Workstation queries the dataset to retrieve the appropriate values and aggregates them according to the function selected by the user. A maximum of four dimensions (<i>rows, columns, sub-rows and sub-columns</i>) can be selected to generate pivot table. The final output can be customized (<i>colors, fonts, size</i>) and it can be exported to Excel or embedded in web sites.</div><br><table style="border: 1px solid #1D4589; background-color: #D0DDED; color: #1D4589;"><tr><td align='center' class='manualSummary'><b>Contents</b></td></tr><tr><td class='manualSummary'><a href='#quickstart'>1 Quick Start</a></td></tr><tr><td class='manualSummary'><a href='#structure'>2 Structure of the Tool</a></td></tr><tr><td class='manualSummary'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='#controller'>2.1 The Controller</a></td></tr><tr><td class='manualSummary'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='#toolbar'>2.2 The Toolbar</a></td></tr></tr></table><br><div class='manual title sub'><a name='quickstart'>Quick Start</a></div><br><div class='manual'>This section guides the user in the creation of a basic table.

There are five easy steps to follow to create a multidimensional table:<br><br><b>1) </b>In the <i>Datasource</i> section of the <a href='#controller'>Controller</a> click on the <i>Add Dataset</i> button. The Resource Explorer is shown to the user that can use it to browse available datasets. Double-click on the dataset of interest to select it to create the pivot table<br><br><b>2) </b>In a pivot table data is shown as the intersection of the variables listed as column and row headers (<i>e.g. commodity VS market</i>). This intersection may contain more than a value, thus it is necessary to define an aggregation function for these values. In the <i>Aggregation Function</i> section user selects the function that is applied to create the table. Function is selected by clicking on it, FENIX Workstation use the highlghted entry in the list to perform the aggregation.<br><br><b>3) </b>Click on the <i>Columns</i> section to expand it. The <i>Dimensions</i> list contains all the dimensions of the selected datasource, except the ones that contain numeric values. When a dimension is selected, the <i>Values</i> box shows all the available values of the selected dimension. All the highlighted entries in the <i>Values</i> box are used as column headers in the output table. By default, all the values are pre-selected. To select/de-select more than a value in the list, hold CTRL and click on the values of interest. To select/de-select a range of values, click on the first value, hold SHIFT and click on the last value of the range.<br><br><b>4) </b>Repeat the procedure of point 3 for the <i>Rows</i> section.<br><br><b>5) </b>Click on the <i>Create Multidimensional Table</i> in the <a href='#toolbar'>Toolbar</a> to generate the pivot table.</div><br><div class='manual title sub'><a name='structure'>Structure of the Tool</a></div><br><div class='manual'>All the functionalities of this tool are accessible through: the Controller (on the left part of this window) and the Toolbar (on the top).</div><br><div class='manual title sub'><a name='controller'>The Controller</a></div><br><div class='manual'>The left part of this window is the Controller, which is divided in 9 sections: <i>Datasource</i>, <i>Aggregation Function</i>, <i>Columns</i>, <i>Rows</i>, <i>Sub-Columns</i>, <i>Sub-Rows</i>, <i>Dimension To Plot</i>, <i>Settings</i> and <i>Format</i>. Only four of these sections are needed to create a basic table: <i>Datasource</i>, <i>Aggregation Function</i>, <i>Rows</i> and <i>Columns</i>; all the remaining ones are used to create tables with more than two dimensions (<i>up to four</i>) or to customize the output.
